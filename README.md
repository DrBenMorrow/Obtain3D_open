Modified stereo-microscopy 
This computer code calculates the third dimension of information in tranmission electron micrographs using two images taken at different perspective of the same region. This is performed by a discrete-geometric approach that treats features as points, or series of points. Points correspond, but are not limited, to the center of cavities or precipitates, positions of irradiation black dot damage, positions along a dislocation line, or positions along where aninterface meets a free surface. Features can include dislocations, interfaces, cavities, precipitates, inclusions etc. The x, yand z coordinates of the points are output in a text file. The code also allows the user to visualize the features containing the points in three dimensions.
